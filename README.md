A matching game

To play, download and extract files. Then open whitematchinggame.html in your browser.

Disclaimer --- I am not liable for any heart attacks caused by the first hearing of the sound effects. It is a bit jarring at first, especially if the volume is turned up and you are wearing headphones. The music however, is quite lovely.
